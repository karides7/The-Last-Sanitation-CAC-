    <h1 class="scrollingText" style="top: 0%; padding: 0%; margin: 0%;">By 2050, the UNPE projects that waste generation will hit 3.8 billion metric tonnes annually.

By 2040, the OECD estimates that 5.4 million tonnes of microplastics will have percolated into the environment.

Polyester, nylon, acrylic, and other synthetic fibers can shed microplastics—pieces of plastic less than 5 mm long, which, being plastic, do not naturally degrade.

2.7 million tonnes of microplastics seeped into the environment in 2020, an estimate expected to double by 2040.

The purpose of The Last Sanitation is to increase awareness about both the world’s greater pollution and garbage problem, and the equally serious and burgeoning issue of microplastic contamination. The concept behind making a web game on the topic is that anybody—importantly those who wouldn’t have looked up waste statistics themselves—could be drawn to play this short game, and voluntarily inform themselves via the information that the game is laden with.
